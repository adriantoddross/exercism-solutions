# Exercism Solutions
## JavaScript Track
Welcome! üòÅ These are my solutions to exercises for the JavaScript track on [Exercism](http://exercism.io/).

### Why am I doing this?

I practice on Exercism every weekday at work to become better at problem solving, more knowledgeable of Javascript's various methods, and to discover blind spots in my knowledge of Javascript overall. These exercises provide a huge confidence boost for me, even if it takes me a few days to work out the solutions to simple problems. I've always been apprehensive about laying down code and needed to teach myself how to take baby steps in pseudocoding, solving problems, and refactoring solutions.
